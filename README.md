# Keep Android Open

**Keep Android Open** is a [community advocacy website](https://keepandroidopen.org) fighting against Google's 2025 developer verification mandate, which will require all developers to be registered with Google.
You can find more details [here](/index.md).

## Purpose

Launched in direct response to the Google announcement, the site defends Android's core promise: an open platform where anyone can build, share, and install apps without centralized gatekeeping.
It aims to inform on the impacts on consumers, developers, states and coordinate resistance.
